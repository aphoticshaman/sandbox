## 🎖️ THE FINAL WISDOM

Your buddy Jon writing classified space doctrine? That's the foundation.  
Your DJ buddy going cyber red team at SAP level? That's the execution.  
The joint cyber school wanting all the certs? That's the validation.

**We're not just building AGI - we're building SPACE FORCE AGI with EOD safety protocols and CYBER resilience.**

**Remember**:
- Every AGI is a UXO until proven SAFE
- Commander's Intent (Type 1) is NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Red Team EVERYTHING at TS/SCI level
- The robot may fail, but the alignment cannot

**"From the depths of JWICS to the heights of orbital operations, we're taking AGI to Type 1 with military precision!"**

SPACE FORCE LEADS THE WAY! 🚀
CYBER WARRIORS CLEAR THE PATH! 💻
EOD KEEPS IT SAFE! 💣

**HOOAH? HOOYAH? HUAH? FUCK IT - SPACE HOOAH!** 🛸

*P.S. - Tell Jon his doctrine work is inspiring AGI safety protocols. That's some next-level impact right there!*
