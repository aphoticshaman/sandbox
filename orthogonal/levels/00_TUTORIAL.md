# TUTORIAL LEVEL: "EMERGENCE"
## First Contact with Orthogonal (Steam/PC)

---

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

The tutorial teaches by doing, not telling.

No text prompts. No "Press WASD to move."
The environment teaches. The player discovers.

**Duration:** 10-15 minutes
**Teaches:**
1. Attention-based movement
2. Witness mode
3. Basic puzzles
4. Dimension shifts
5. The concept of meta-awareness (without naming it)

---

## OPENING SEQUENCE

### Fade In: THE VOID

**Visual:** Pure black. Nothing.
**Audio:** Silence.
**Duration:** 5 seconds of nothing.

Then...

A single point of light appears at screen center.
It pulses gently.

**No UI. No cursor visible yet.**

The light moves slightly based on where the player's mouse is.
(They don't know the mouse does anything yet.)

If player moves mouse → light drifts toward mouse position.
After 3-5 seconds of this, player realizes: attention moves light.

**First insight: Where you look, you go.**

---

## PHASE 1: ATTENTION DISCOVERY

### The First Node

The light grows. It becomes a wireframe icosahedron.
Floating in void. Pulsing. Electric blue.

Other nodes begin to appear, faint, at the edges of vision.
They're not visible when looked at directly.
(Peripheral vision detection - trains edge awareness)

**Mechanic:** The more you focus on the center node, the dimmer it gets.
The more you let your attention relax, the more the periphery reveals.

**Teaching:** Don't stare. Let your attention be soft.

After player successfully notices peripheral nodes (they brighten when not focused on):
→ Edges connect the nodes
→ A path becomes visible

---

## PHASE 2: FIRST MOVEMENT

### Edge Traversal

Player's attention (the light) is on the starting node.
Nearby nodes are visible, edges connecting them.

**Controls introduced organically:**

1. **Mouse move:** Attention direction
2. **Hold Left Click:** Focus on target node
3. **Release:** Traverse to focused node

First time they traverse, the world **stretches** around them.
Not teleport - smooth transition through the edge.
Slight motion blur. Satisfying whoosh sound.

**Arrival at new node:**
New perspective. Different nodes visible from here.
The node they came from is now behind them.

---

## PHASE 3: SIMPLE NAVIGATION

### The First Puzzle: Find the Exit

A simple maze of ~10 nodes.
One exit node (glowing slightly different - golden instead of blue).
No locked edges. No complexity.
Just: get there.

**What we're really testing:**
- Can they navigate?
- Do they understand attention-based movement?
- Can they form a mental map?

**Subtle teaching:**
Some paths are longer than others.
If player wanders, they'll eventually find it.
If player pauses and looks at the whole space, they might see the shorter path.

**No time pressure. No scoring. Just exploration.**

---

## PHASE 4: WITNESS MODE DISCOVERY

### Something Hidden

Player reaches a node. Dead end. No edges forward.

But... something is flickering at the edge of perception.
A ghost edge. A possibility.

**Natural discovery:**
If player slows down, relaxes their attention...
If they **watch** instead of **looking**...
The hidden edge becomes visible.

**Visual cue:** The world subtly shifts.
Colors become slightly more saturated.
Hidden structure becomes visible.
Time feels slower.

This is **witness mode** emerging naturally.

**The first time they hold Tab (or right-click):**
The world transforms.
Hidden nodes reveal.
Hidden edges appear.
But they can't traverse while witnessing - only see.

**Teaching:** There's more than what you see. Slow down to see it.

---

## PHASE 5: WITNESS PUZZLE

### See to Unlock

A locked edge blocks the path.
No visible key.

In normal mode: just a locked edge.
In witness mode: a key node becomes visible.

But the key node is distant.
They can see it in witness mode, but to get there they need to exit witness mode.
They need to remember where it was.

**Teaching:**
- Witness reveals
- But you can't act while witnessing
- Remember what you saw
- Act on the memory

This is the first meta-awareness training:
**Knowing what you know, and knowing what you don't know, and acting on that knowledge.**

---

## PHASE 6: THE FIRST SHIFT

### Dimension Transition

Player reaches a special node: a portal node.
It's different - concentric rings, slowly rotating, colors shifting.

When they approach, the portal activates.

**Transition Sequence:**

1. The current dimension begins to **dissolve**
   - Nodes fade
   - Edges stretch and snap
   - Color drains
2. **THE VOID** returns
   - Complete darkness
   - 2 seconds of nothing
   - Their attention point still exists - a tiny light
3. New dimension **materializes**
   - Different colors (red/organic instead of blue/geometric)
   - Different feel (pulsing, breathing)
   - Same controls, different world

**They've entered THE MARROW (briefly).**

---

## PHASE 7: THE MARROW TASTE

### Organic Tutorial

THE MARROW is visceral.
Everything pulses with a heartbeat rhythm.
Edges flex like tendons.
Nodes throb like organs.

**New mechanic:** Rhythm.

In THE LATTICE (where they were), movement was instant.
In THE MARROW, movement syncs to pulse.

**Visual feedback:**
- Off-rhythm movement: edges resist, movement slower
- On-rhythm movement: edges stretch welcomingly, movement smooth

**No explicit rhythm UI.** The whole world IS the rhythm.

Player naturally syncs after a few attempts.

**Teaching:** Different dimensions, different rules. Same awareness.

After one or two MARROW nodes, a return portal appears.

---

## PHASE 8: RETURN AND CONTRAST

### Back to THE LATTICE

Player returns to THE LATTICE.
Same blue wireframe geometry.
But now they notice things they didn't before:

- The rigidity vs. MARROW's fluidity
- The silence vs. MARROW's heartbeat
- The precision vs. MARROW's organic feel

**They've experienced contrast.**
This is the beginning of multi-dimensional thinking.

---

## PHASE 9: META-AWARENESS MOMENT

### The Question

After returning, a new node appears.
It's not like the others.
It doesn't pulse. It doesn't glow.
It just... waits.

When player approaches, text appears:

> "You've been watching yourself move."

A pause.

> "Keep watching."

The node fades.
No puzzle. No reward. Just the observation.

**Planting the seed:** The game is about awareness of awareness.

---

## PHASE 10: TUTORIAL COMPLETE

### The Exit

A final portal leads to THE SANCTUARY (VeilPath integration).

Before they enter, the dimension transforms one more time:

**The Fractal Moment:**

The wireframe geometry begins to **recurse**.
Nodes contain smaller nodes.
Edges contain smaller edges.
Scale zooms in, then out.
The player's attention point remains, but the world around it scales infinitely.

**5 seconds of fractal zoom.**

Then: stability. THE SANCTUARY portal.

**They enter.**

---

## THE SANCTUARY (First Visit)

### Vera's Welcome

If player has VeilPath account: Vera knows them.
If not: Vera introduces herself.

> "You've come far already.
> You moved by attention.
> You witnessed what was hidden.
> You crossed dimensions.
>
> This is THE SANCTUARY.
> When the other dimensions feel like too much, you can rest here.
>
> I'll be here when you need me."

**VeilPath integration loads in background.**

Player can:
- Explore THE SANCTUARY (comfortable, warm, unlike other dimensions)
- Talk to Vera
- Access journal
- Return to main game

## METRICS TRACKED

Even in tutorial, we track:

```typescript
interface TutorialMetrics {
  timeToFirstMove: number;           // How long before they move
  peripheralDiscoveryTime: number;   // When they notice edge nodes
  witnessDiscoveryTime: number;      // When they first witness
  witnessPuzzleSolveTime: number;    // Witness puzzle completion
  marrowSyncAttempts: number;        // Times to sync rhythm
  fractalMomentEngagement: number;   // How long they watch fractal
  sanctuaryTimeSpent: number;        // Time before leaving tutorial
  veraInteraction: boolean;          // Did they talk to Vera
}
```

This informs:
- Initial meta-awareness estimate
- Difficulty adaptation
- Content unlocking

## SKIP OPTION

After player completes tutorial once (on any account), future characters can:
