## Copyright Considerations

- Song titles are NOT copyrighted (can use freely)
- Lyrics cannot be directly quoted (fair use short phrases only)
- Artist names can be referenced obliquely
- Focus on themes, vibes, and subtle nods
- Never use actual song recordings without licensing

**Safe Examples:**
- ✅ "Where Is My Mind?" as location name
- ✅ "Stay woke" as dialog (common phrase, Redbone popularized)
- ✅ "Lucid Dream Catcher" item (descriptive, not direct quote)
- ❌ Quoting full verse lyrics
- ❌ Using album artwork without permission
- ❌ Character named "Kendrick Lamar"

**Strategy: WoW-Style Homage**
- Make it OBVIOUS to fans who get it
- Make it INVISIBLE to those who don't
- NEVER so direct it's copyright infringement
