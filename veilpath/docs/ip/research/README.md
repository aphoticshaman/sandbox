## Paper Summaries

### 1. RRBR: Resilient Risk-Balanced Returns Framework
**File:** [RRBR_FRAMEWORK.md](RRBR_FRAMEWORK.md)

**Core Innovation:**
Asymmetric gain preservation using optimal κ* = 1.0 sensitivity parameter:
- 1.1× multiplier for gains (preserve momentum)
- 0.5× multiplier for losses (aggressive dampening)

**Applications:**
- Portfolio management
- Decision systems under uncertainty
- Gamification reward structures (VeilPath XP system)

**Status:** Theory complete, awaiting Zenodo formatting

---

### 2. Kuramoto-PSAN: Psychological State-Adaptive Networks
**File:** [KURAMOTO_PSAN.md](KURAMOTO_PSAN.md)

**Core Innovation:**
Apply Kuramoto order parameter (coupled oscillator physics) to behavioral micro-signals for real-time psychological state detection.

**Key Results:**
- r = 0.9881 correlation with Flow Short Scale (FSS-2)
- 95%+ classification accuracy across states
- Zero additional hardware required

**Patent Connection:** 63/925,467 (Kuramoto Flow Detection)

**Status:** Theory + implementation complete, validation pending

---

### 3. HTUM-TIIG: Hyperbolic Topological Unified Model with Topological Information Integration Geometry
**File:** [HTUM_TIIG.md](HTUM_TIIG.md)

**Core Innovation:**
Propose consciousness as a topological invariant arising from information integration geometry in hyperbolic space.

**Key Claims:**
- Φ (integrated information) maps to topological genus
- Conscious states = stable attractors in hyperbolic manifold
- Explains binding problem via topological connectivity

**Status:** Theoretical framework, requires mathematical formalization

---

### 4. Bootstrap-RRM: Bootstrap Cosmology with Recursive Reality Mapping
**File:** [BOOTSTRAP_RRM.md](BOOTSTRAP_RRM.md)

**Core Innovation:**
Cosmological model where physical laws emerge from self-referential consistency constraints ("bootstrap" from recursive reality mapping).

**Key Claims:**
- Fine-tuning explained by consistency selection
- Dark energy as entrenchment gradient
- Multiverse as solution space of bootstrap equations

**Status:** Speculative, needs peer review

---

### 5. CDIS: Cross-Dimensional Information Substrate
**File:** [CDIS.md](CDIS.md)

**Core Innovation:**
Information as fundamental substrate spanning dimensional boundaries, with physical laws as dimensional projections of informational constraints.

**Key Claims:**
- Holographic principle as special case
- Quantum entanglement as cross-dimensional information sharing
- Consciousness as high-dimensional information structure

**Status:** Highly speculative, philosophical grounding

## Publication Strategy

### Zenodo Benefits
- Instant DOI assignment
- Permanent archival
- No peer review gatekeeping
- Version control
- Citation tracking

### Recommended Order
1. **Kuramoto-PSAN** (strongest empirical claims, patent-backed)
2. **RRBR Framework** (practical applications, clear math)
3. **HTUM-TIIG** (theoretical but rigorous)
4. **Bootstrap-RRM** (speculative but interesting)
5. **CDIS** (most speculative, build credibility first)

## Risk Assessment

### Verified Claims
- Mathematical frameworks (RRBR, Kuramoto equations)
- Implementation code (PSAN Tri-Fork)
- Logical consistency of theoretical models

### Unverified Claims (Require Independent Validation)
- r = 0.9881 correlation (Kuramoto-PSAN)
- 18-34% coherence improvement (PSAN)
- 146-180x speedup (K×f pruning)
- All experimental benchmarks

### Mitigation
- Publish as "theoretical framework" papers
- State assumptions explicitly
- Invite replication
- Separate theory (Zenodo) from implementation (patent)
