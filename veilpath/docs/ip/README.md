## Portfolio Overview

This repository serves as the documentation hub for a vertically-integrated IP strategy spanning:
- **Consumer Applications** (VeilPath wellness platform)
- **Defense/Enterprise Licensing** (SBIR grants, prime contractor licensing)
- **Academic Publication** (Zenodo open-access papers)

### Core Innovation Thesis

All IP centers on a unified insight: **phi-scaled dynamics create maximally stable quasi-periodic systems** due to the golden ratio's unique property as the "most irrational" number (KAM theory). This principle applies across:

| Domain | Application | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Neural Networks | Long-context coherence via PSAN architecture | Patent Filed |
| Human Psychology | Flow state detection via Kuramoto coherence | Patent Filed |
| Code Generation | Casimir-effect complexity minimization | Ready to File |
| Model Optimization | K×f multiplicative pruning | Patent Filed |

## Patent Portfolio

| Patent | Application # | Filed | Status | Est. Value |
|--------|---------------|-------|--------|------------|
| [PSAN Tri-Fork](patents/PSAN_TRIFORK.md) | 63/925,504 | Nov 26, 2025 | Provisional | ★★★★★ |
| [Kuramoto Flow Detection](patents/KURAMOTO_FLOW.md) | 63/925,467 | Nov 25, 2025 | Provisional | ★★★★★ |
| [K×f Multiplicative Pruning](patents/KXF_PRUNING.md) | Pending | Nov 26, 2025 | Provisional | ★★★★☆ |
| [Casimir Code Generation](patents/CASIMIR_CODEGEN.md) | — | Ready | $75 to file | ★★★★☆ |
| [Sanskrit Phonetic Mapping](patents/SANSKRIT_PHONETIC.md) | 63/925,467 | Nov 25, 2025 | Provisional | ★★★☆☆ |

### Patent Strategy

1. **Provisional → Non-Provisional**: 12-month window to file full applications
2. **PCT International**: Extend protection to EU, Asia markets
3. **Defense Licensing**: Target prime contractors via SBIR Phase I/II
4. **Cross-Licensing**: Bundle related patents for enterprise deals

## VeilPath Integration Points

The IP portfolio connects to VeilPath in several ways:

### Direct Implementation
- **Kuramoto coherence** → Real-time flow state detection in meditation features
- **Golden ratio timing** → phi-cascade animations and breathing exercises
- **Coherence-gated progression** → Gamification based on sustained quality

### Future Features (R&D Pathways)
- **PSAN architecture** → On-device AI for personalized interpretations
- **K×f pruning** → Model compression for mobile deployment
- **Sanskrit mapping** → Enhanced symbolism engine

---

## Licensing Strategy

### Consumer (VeilPath)
- Free tier with premium subscriptions
- No patent licensing required (internal use)

### Enterprise/Defense
- SBIR Phase I: $50K-$275K grants
- SBIR Phase II: $750K-$1.5M contracts
- Prime contractor licensing: Negotiate per-seat or revenue share
- Target: Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Palantir

### Academic
- Zenodo papers under CC-BY for citation building
- Patent protection maintained separately
