## USAGE NOTES

### Batch Generation Strategy

1. **Generate in sets of 10-20** to check consistency
2. **Start with Major Arcana** (most important 22 cards)
3. **Then do suits one at a time** (Wands, Cups, Swords, Pentacles)
4. **Use --sref** once you have a perfect card to maintain style
5. **Upscale only the keepers** (don't waste generations)

### After Midjourney Generation

**You'll hand them to Claude for cleanup:**
1. Remove any watermarks/artifacts
2. Normalize colors across all 78 cards
3. Auto-crop to consistent dimensions
4. Add transparent backgrounds if needed
5. Resize to optimal resolution (recommend 1024x1536 for 2:3)
6. Optimize file size

### Tools for Cleanup

```bash
# Batch normalize all cards to same palette
python tools/image_tools.py batch \
  raw_tarot_cards/ \
  normalized_tarot/ \
  normalize \
  --reference best_card.png

# Batch crop all cards
python tools/image_tools.py batch \
  normalized_tarot/ \
  cropped_tarot/ \
  crop

# Batch optimize file size
python tools/image_tools.py batch \
  cropped_tarot/ \
  final_tarot/ \
  optimize
```

## HISTORICAL ACCURACY NOTES

All prompts include authentic RWS symbolism:
- Specific figure poses and gestures from original deck
- Correct symbolic objects (staffs, cups, swords, pentacles)
- Accurate background elements (mountains, water, architecture)
- Proper color associations where traditional
- Correct number of objects matching card number

**Cyberpunk aesthetic adds:**
- Holographic effects on symbols
- Neon accents (purple/cyan palette)
- Bioluminescent natural elements
- Sacred geometry patterns
- Circuit-pattern borders

**Result:** Historically faithful + visually cohesive modern aesthetic

**Total: 78 cards ready for generation. Feed to Midjourney, get art back, hand to Claude for cleanup. Done.**
