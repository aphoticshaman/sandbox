# VeilPath Tarot: Monetization Architecture

**Strategy:** Battle Pass + Rotating Shop + Premium Currency
**Inspiration:** Fortnite Crew, Destiny 2 Eververse, Genshin Impact

---

## Design Inspirations

### Narrative & Atmosphere

**Planescape: Torment / Tides of Numenera:**
- Heavy, philosophical text
- Strange, metaphysical world-building (The Veil, liminal spaces, consciousness)
- Weird NPCs with complex motivations (Luna and Sol as enigmatic guides, not generic angels)
- Existential themes: "What can change the nature of a reading?"
- Choice-driven, reactive interpretations
- Mature, introspective, confronting shadow aspects

**Fallout 1 & 2:**
- Dark, gritty atmosphere without being edgy
- Isometric perspective aesthetic for card layouts
- Post-apocalyptic spirituality (finding meaning in ruins of self)
- Dark humor mixed with sincere wisdom
- Choice-driven outcomes (quest paths diverge based on player reflection)
- Text-heavy, slow-paced, contemplative

**Hearthstone:**
- Clean, readable cosmetic rarity (Standard/Gilded/Artifact)
- Generous free-to-play model with premium options
- Seasonal content keeps economy fresh
- Cosmetics enhance without gating core experience

### Visual Aesthetic

**Renaissance Illuminated Manuscripts:**
- Gold leaf, intricate filigree (Gilded tier)
- Hand-lettered, ornate borders
- Rich, symbolic imagery

**Art Nouveau:**
- Flowing, organic patterns
- Nature motifs (moon phases, vines, celestial bodies)
- Elegant, decorative frames

**Gothic Fantasy:**
- Moonlit, twilight atmosphere (never fully dark, never fully light)
- Stone ruins, candlelit altars, ancient forests
- Purple/violet and gold color palette (Shadowlands signature)

---

## Revenue Streams

### 1. Shadowlands Pass (Battle Pass)
**Price:** $4.99/month (auto-renewing subscription)

**Instant Unlocks:**
- 500 Veil Shards immediately
- Current season's exclusive card back
- Luna OR Sol narrator unlock (choose one)

**Monthly Allowance (renewal day):**
- 300 bonus Veil Shards
- 1 Moon Key (unlock previous season cosmetics)

**Seasonal Progression (50 Tiers):**
- Earn through quests, not purchases
- Free track: Basic rewards every 15-20 tiers
- Premium track: Cosmetics every 5 tiers
- Tier 50: Complete premium Major Arcana art set

**Earning Mechanics:**
- Daily quests: 5 XP → ~7 days per tier (passive players)
- Weekly quests: 20 XP → active players finish in 30-35 days
- Reading rituals: Complete readings with intention → bonus XP
- Shadow work: Reflective journaling → bonus XP

### 2. Rotating Shop (Microtransactions)
**Daily Rotation:** 4 items
**Weekly Rotation:** 6 items (resets Monday)

**Cosmetic Categories:**
- **Card Backs** (50-300 Veil Shards)
- **Tarot Tables** (100-500 Veil Shards)
- **PC Skins** (200-800 Veil Shards)
- **Spreads** (150-400 Veil Shards)

- 300 Shards: $2.99

- 3,500 Shards: $19.99 (145% bonus)
- 7,500 Shards: $39.99 (190% bonus)

**Psychology:**
- $4.99 tier = Battle Pass price (encourage subscription instead)
- $9.99 tier = "I want 2-3 cosmetics now"
- $19.99+ = whales, seasonal splurges

### 4. Moonlight (Soft Currency)
**Earning:**
- Daily login: 25 Moonlight
- Complete reading: 10 Moonlight
- Quest completion: 15-50 Moonlight
- Achievements: 100-500 Moonlight

**Spending:**
- Basic spreads (5-card, relationship): 25-50 Moonlight
- Unlock common cosmetics: 500-1000 Moonlight
- Convert to Veil Shards: 1000 Moonlight = 50 Shards (bad rate, but possible)

**Purpose:** Engagement currency, gives non-payers progression

## Rarity System (PUBLIC - Hearthstone-Style)

**Inspired by:** Hearthstone's Standard/Golden/Diamond tiers

Three simple, clear tiers that players understand instantly:

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Clear, Simple Rarity Tiers
Three tiers players instantly understand:
- **Standard** = Beautiful, accessible
- **Gilded** = Premium, animated, gold leaf
- **Artifact** = Ultra-rare, legendary status
- No confusion, no 7-tier complexity
- Every tier has high-quality art (no filler/trash)

### 2. FOMO Without Predatory Practices
- Daily/weekly rotations create urgency
- But cosmetics eventually return
- Moon Keys let players unlock past seasons (anti-FOMO mechanic)
- No loot boxes, no gambling

### 3. Earn OR Buy (Hybrid Model)
- Battle Pass: Earn through quests (engagement)
- Shop: Buy instantly (whales, impulse)
- Moonlight: F2P can slowly earn cosmetics
- Everyone feels progression, whales feel special

### 4. Seasonal Content Keeps It Fresh
- 50-60 new cosmetics every 3 months
- Always something new in rotation
- Prevents stale economy
- Midjourney makes production cheap

### 5. Cosmetics Enhance, Don't Gate
- All spreads functionally available (Moonlight or small Shard cost)
- Cosmetics are pure expression, not power
- Premium card art doesn't give "better" readings
- Ethical monetization

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 4:** Build dark fantasy UI foundation
2. **Phase 5:** Generate Season 1 cosmetics (Frozen Veil)
3. **Phase 6:** Implement shop rotation system
4. **Phase 7:** Launch Battle Pass beta
5. **Phase 8:** Iterate based on player data

**All infrastructure ready. Time to make it beautiful.** 🌙✨
