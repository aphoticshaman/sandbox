## Conclusion

VeilPath is NOT a tarot app that added some features.
VeilPath is a MENTAL HEALTH PLATFORM that uses tarot as its engaging, symbolic interface.

This positions us in a less saturated market (mental health apps) with a unique differentiator (tarot interface) rather than competing in an oversaturated market (tarot apps) with generic features.

**Apple will approve this because it provides genuine value, uses evidence-based practices, and fills a unique niche in the mental health space.**
