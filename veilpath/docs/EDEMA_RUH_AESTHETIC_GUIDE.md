## Respectful Representation Notes

**Important:** While drawing inspiration from Romani culture for a fantasy aesthetic:

1. **Avoid stereotypes** - Don't reduce culture to "mysterious fortune teller" trope
2. **Show depth** - Portray as skilled artisans, musicians, storytellers (not just mystical)
3. **Respectful language** - Use "Romani" rather than outdated/offensive terms
4. **Cultural appreciation, not appropriation** - Honor the real traditions that inspire
5. **Acknowledge prejudice** - The books show how Edema Ruh face discrimination (like real Roma)
6. **Celebrate artistry** - Focus on their excellence in performance arts, metalwork, storytelling

This is a FANTASY game inspired by FICTION (Edema Ruh) which draws from REAL culture (Romani).
Treat with respect, celebrate the beauty, acknowledge the complexity.
