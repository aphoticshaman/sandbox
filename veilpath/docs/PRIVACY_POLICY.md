## 2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

### 2.1 Core Functionality
**To Make the App Work:**
- Store your journals, readings, progress
- Sync across devices (if you enable cloud sync)
- Generate personalized prompts based on your history
- Track achievements and streaks

### 2.2 Improvement & Analytics
**To Make the App Better:**
- Understand which features are helpful (aggregated, anonymous data)
- Fix bugs and crashes
- Improve therapeutic content based on usage patterns
- A/B test new features (with opt-in)

**Example:**
- We might see "70% of users prefer 3-card spreads over 5-card" (anonymous)
- We do NOT see "John Smith prefers 3-card spreads" (never individualized)

### 2.3 Communication
**To Reach You (Opt-In Only):**
- Email updates about new features (if you provided email and opted in)
- In-app notifications about achievements, streaks (can disable)
- Support responses if you contact us

**We DO NOT:**
- ❌ Spam you
- ❌ Sell your email to marketers
- ❌ Send unsolicited promotions

### 2.4 Legal Compliance
**Only When Legally Required:**
- Comply with valid legal process (subpoena, court order)
- Protect our rights or safety of users
- Investigate fraud or abuse

**Note:** We have minimal data to hand over even if compelled. Your journals are on YOUR device.

## 3. DATA STORAGE & SECURITY

### 3.1 Local-First Architecture
**Default: Everything Stays on Your Device**
- Journals, readings, mood data stored in local database
- Encrypted at rest (device-level encryption)
- Not accessible to us or anyone else

**Why This Matters:**
- We can't read your journals (even if we wanted to)
- If your device is lost, your data is protected
- No server breach can expose your thoughts

### 3.2 Cloud Sync (Optional)
**If You Enable Cloud Backup:**
- Data is encrypted end-to-end before leaving your device
- Stored on secure servers (AWS/Google Cloud with encryption)
- Only you can decrypt (we don't have the key)

**How It Works:**
1. Your data is encrypted on your device
2. Encrypted data is sent to cloud
3. Only your device with your password can decrypt

**Even if our servers are compromised, your data is gibberish without your key.**

### 3.3 Security Measures
**We implement:**
- Encryption in transit (TLS/SSL)
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Regular security audits
- Minimal data retention
- Access controls (only essential staff)

**What We DON'T Do:**
- ❌ Store unencrypted journals
- ❌ Share data with third parties for marketing
- ❌ Use your content to train AI models (without explicit consent)

4. Claude analyzes for cognitive distortions, suggests reframes
5. Insights are shown to you
6. **Anthropic does NOT permanently store your journal**

### 4.2 Anthropic Privacy
**Per Anthropic's Data Policy:**
- API requests are NOT used to train their models
