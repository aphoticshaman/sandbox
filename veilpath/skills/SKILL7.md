**Target**: Technical founder with AI/ML skills, limited capital, high ambition
**Timeline**: 6-18 months to $15K/month recurring

---

## 1. YOUR STRENGTHS ANALYSIS

Based on observed work patterns and outputs:

### 1.1 Technical Strengths

**Systems Architecture**
- Designed NSM (6-domain fusion engine) from first principles
- Built SDPM (Sanskrit phonetic encoding) - novel approach
- XYZ semantic coordinate systems
- Actor model for concurrency
- On-device LLM integration

**Deep Technical Range**
- React Native mobile development
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- LLM inference and optimization
- Quantization (GGUF, token optimization)
- Git workflows (though we fight about them)

**Novel Thinking**
- You don't copy existing solutions
- You synthesize across domains (Sanskrit + ML + personality systems)
- First principles over pattern matching

### 1.2 Working Style Strengths

**Managing AI Effectively**
- You push back when I'm wrong
- You give context when needed
- You know when something "feels wrong"
- You iterate rapidly

**Product Intuition**
- "Less flowery bullshit" - you know when output sucks
- UX decisions driven by feel, not just logic
- Understand the user perspective

**Persistence**
- Long debugging sessions
- Push through complexity
- Don't give up when stuck

### 1.3 Gaps to Address

**Marketing/Sales**: Technical founder weakness - need to learn or partner
**Consistency**: Session-to-session context loss causes rework
**Scope Management**: Big visions need phased execution
**Revenue Focus**: Building cool tech vs. building what sells

## 4. FINANCIAL MODEL

### Conservative Path (Freelancing-heavy)

| Month | Freelance | Products | Total |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1-3 | $8K | $0 | $8K |
| 4-6 | $10K | $1K | $11K |
| 7-9 | $8K | $4K | $12K |
| 10-12 | $5K | $10K | $15K |

### Aggressive Path (Product-focused)

| Month | Freelance | Products | Total |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1-3 | $6K | $0 | $6K |
| 4-6 | $4K | $3K | $7K |
| 7-9 | $2K | $8K | $10K |
| 10-12 | $0 | $15K+ | $15K+ |

### Your Target Needs

- Wedding: $20K
- IVF + baby + remodel: $20K
- Debt: ???
- Car: $15-25K
- **Total**: $55-65K minimum

**Timeline to $60K savings** (assuming $15K/month, $5K expenses):
- 6 months after reaching $15K/month
- Total timeline: ~18 months

---

## 5. PRODUCT DEEP DIVES

### 5.1 On-Device LLM Toolkit (Fastest Revenue)

**The Product**:
```
npm install @ondevice/llm

import { LLM } from '@ondevice/llm';

const llm = new LLM({
  model: 'phi-3-mini',
  quality: 'balanced', // fast, balanced, quality
});

const response = await llm.complete('Hello, how are you?');
```

**What You Provide**:
- Pre-optimized GGUF models for mobile
- React Native / Flutter / native SDKs
- Automatic hardware detection
- Memory management
- Quality presets

**Moat**: The optimization is hard. You've already done it for Lunatiq.

**Pricing**:
- Free: 1 model, basic features
- Pro: $49/month - all models, premium features
- Enterprise: Custom

**GTM**:
1. Open source core library
2. Documentation + examples
3. Blog posts on mobile LLM optimization
4. Dev community presence (Reddit, Discord, X)

### 5.2 Photonic Computing Abstraction (Biggest Opportunity)

**The Problem**:
- Hardware vendors have proprietary tools
- No standard programming model
- Developers can't experiment without buying hardware
- No way to write portable code

**The Solution**:
```python
from photon import PhotonicCircuit, simulate, compile

# Define computation
circuit = PhotonicCircuit()
circuit.add_linear_layer(64, 32)
circuit.add_nonlinearity('electronic_relu')
circuit.add_linear_layer(32, 10)

# Simulate locally
result = simulate(circuit, input_data)

# Compile to hardware
lightmatter_binary = compile(circuit, target='lightmatter')
luminous_binary = compile(circuit, target='luminous')
```

**What You Provide**:
- Hardware-agnostic circuit representation
- Accurate simulation (noise models)
- Compilation to multiple backends
- Optimization passes
- Training support

**Moat**: First mover. Once people learn your abstraction, switching cost is high.

**Pricing**:
- Open source simulator
- Paid compiler backends ($99/month)
- Enterprise support

**GTM**:
1. Academic partnerships (MIT, Stanford photonics groups)
2. Hardware vendor partnerships
3. Technical content (papers, blog)
4. Workshops at ML conferences

**Risk**: Market timing. Photonic hardware may be 2-3 years from mainstream.

### 5.3 AI Agent Framework (Leverage Existing)

**The Product**: Your Oracle architecture, generalized.

```python
from oracleagent import Agent, Memory, Tool

# Define agent
agent = Agent(
    personality={
        'tone': 0.7,
        'formality': 0.5,
        'coaching': 0.8,
    },
    memory=Memory(
        episodic=True,
        semantic=True,
        window=10,
    ),
    tools=[
        Tool('search', search_fn),
        Tool('calculate', calc_fn),
    ]
)

# Run
response = agent.run('Help me plan my day')
```

**Differentiation from LangChain/AutoGen**:
- Sanskrit-inspired personality encoding
- NSM multi-modal fusion
- Actor model concurrency
- First-class memory system

**Pricing**:
- Open source core
- Paid: Hosted memory, monitoring, analytics
- Enterprise: Custom deployment
