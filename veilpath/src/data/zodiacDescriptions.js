  'Aries': 'The fearless pioneer of the zodiac, Aries charges forward with raw courage and unapologetic authenticity. You don\'t wait for permission—you create your own path, fueled by an inner fire that refuses to dim. Your greatest strength is your willingness to begin, to take the first step when everyone else hesitates. But this same fire can burn bridges if left unchecked. Learning to pause, to channel your warrior energy with wisdom rather than impulse, is your life\'s work. You\'re here to lead, to inspire others through bold action, and to prove that fear is just fuel for transformation. The world needs your courage, but it also needs you to understand that true strength includes vulnerability and patience.',
  'Taurus': 'You are the embodiment of earth\'s steady power—grounded, sensual, and unshakeable when rooted in your values. While others chase fleeting trends, you build empires of beauty, comfort, and lasting worth. Your relationship with the physical world—food, touch, nature, art—runs deep. You understand that pleasure isn\'t frivolous; it\'s sacred. But your greatest challenge is the shadow side of stability: stubbornness that becomes rigidity, comfort that becomes stagnation. Growth asks you to release what no longer serves, even when letting go feels like tearing apart your foundation. You\'re learning that true security comes from within, not from external accumulation. When you master this, you become the alchemist who transforms raw earth into gold.',
  'Gemini': 'Your mind is a kaleidoscope, constantly shifting perspectives, connecting dots others can\'t see. You\'re the storyteller, the messenger, the one who translates complexity into clarity. Your superpower is adaptability—you can become anyone, speak any language, navigate any social terrain. But this gift becomes a curse when you lose yourself in the performance, when you become so many people that you forget who you actually are. Your life\'s work is integration: bringing all your fragmented selves into wholeness, finding your authentic voice beneath the clever words. When you ground your brilliant mind in embodied truth, you become the bridge between worlds, the translator of human experience.',
  'Cancer': 'You feel everything. The moon governs your tides, and you understand emotional truth in a way others can only theorize about. Your gift is your capacity to nurture, to create safe spaces where others can finally exhale. You\'re the keeper of memories, the guardian of home, the one who remembers everyone\'s birthday. But your challenge is learning that you can\'t heal the world by absorbing its pain, that empathy without boundaries destroys you. Your shell isn\'t armor—it\'s a necessary threshold. You\'re here to teach humanity about emotional intelligence, to model that feelings aren\'t weaknesses but portals to deeper wisdom. When you learn to mother yourself as fiercely as you mother others, you become unstoppable.',
  'Leo': 'You are solar fire incarnate—radiant, creative, impossible to ignore. You don\'t just enter rooms; you transform them with your presence. Your heart is generous to the point of recklessness, and you believe in magic because you are magic. But your shadow lurks in the need for constant validation, the performance that becomes prison. You\'re learning that true sovereignty doesn\'t require an audience, that your light doesn\'t dim when others shine. Your life\'s work is recognizing that you\'re already the main character in your own story—you don\'t need to prove it. When you step into authentic self-love rather than ego-driven performance, you become the sun that makes everything else grow.',
  'Virgo': 'You see what\'s broken and know how to fix it. Your mind is a precision instrument, analyzing, refining, perfecting. You serve others through excellence, through attention to details everyone else overlooks. But your greatest strength becomes your deepest wound when perfectionism turns into paralysis, when "not good enough" becomes your mantra. You\'re learning that wholeness doesn\'t require perfection, that your worth isn\'t measured by your productivity. Your sacred work is self-compassion—offering yourself the same grace you extend to others. When you integrate your critical mind with your tender heart, you become the healer who knows that true medicine begins with acceptance, not fixing.',
  'Libra': 'You are the diplomat, the artist, the one who sees beauty in balance. Your gift is your ability to hold multiple perspectives, to find harmony in chaos, to create peace where there was conflict. You understand that relationships are the crucible where we become fully human. But your shadow emerges in the loss of self, in the performance of agreeability, in avoiding confrontation at the cost of your truth. You\'re learning that real peace doesn\'t require you to silence your voice, that true partnership demands your full authentic presence. Your life\'s work is mastering the art of assertive grace—saying no with love, setting boundaries without guilt, standing in your truth while honoring others.',
  'Scorpio': 'You are the alchemist, the phoenix, the one who isn\'t afraid to descend into hell because you know resurrection awaits. Intensity is your native language—you don\'t do surface, you don\'t do shallow, you don\'t do fake. Your power lies in your willingness to face what others flee: death, sex, shadow, transformation. But your gift becomes poison when you weaponize it, when you manipulate instead of empower, when you hoard your power instead of sharing it. You\'re learning that true strength is vulnerability, that control is an illusion, that surrender is the path to rebirth. When you channel your depth toward healing rather than destruction, you become the guide who shows others that their darkness holds their greatest light.',
  'Sagittarius': 'You are the eternal optimist, the philosopher-adventurer who believes life is meant to be lived at full volume. Your spirit can\'t be caged—you need freedom like others need air. Your gift is your ability to find meaning in chaos, to see the big picture when others are lost in details, to inspire through your contagious faith in possibilities. But your shadow appears in reckless escapism, in spiritual bypassing, in running from commitment under the guise of "seeking." You\'re learning that true freedom isn\'t running away; it\'s the ability to stay and still feel expansive. Your work is grounding your vast vision in tangible reality, bringing your philosophy to earth.',
  'Capricorn': 'You are the mountain—steady, enduring, built to last. While others chase shortcuts, you understand that mastery requires time, that empires are built brick by brick. Your relationship with discipline borders on sacred; you know that structure isn\'t limitation—it\'s the foundation of true freedom. But your shadow emerges when ambition becomes addiction, when you climb so high you forget why you started, when achievement replaces authentic connection. You\'re learning that success without soul is hollow, that your worth isn\'t your resume. Your sacred work is integrating your heart with your hustle, remembering that the summit means nothing if you sacrificed your humanity to reach it.',
  'Aquarius': 'You are the revolutionary, the visionary who sees futures others can\'t imagine. You\'re wired differently—your mind operates on frequencies most people can\'t access. Your gift is your capacity to detach from groupthink, to question everything, to champion the underdog, to believe in human potential when evidence suggests otherwise. But your shadow lives in disconnection, in intellectualizing emotions, in sacrificing intimacy for ideology. You\'re learning that revolution begins with self, that you can\'t heal humanity while bypassing your own wounds. Your work is bringing your brilliant vision down from the clouds and into embodied relationship, remembering that we\'re all in this together.',
  'Pisces': 'You are the mystic, the empath, the one whose boundaries between self and universe blur. You feel the collective pain and joy as if it were your own because, to you, it is. Your gift is your capacity to channel the divine, to create art that heals, to love without conditions. You understand that reality is fluid, that magic is real, that we\'re all connected in ways science is only beginning to understand. But your shadow emerges in martyrdom, in losing yourself to save others, in escaping reality through addiction or fantasy. You\'re learning that true compassion includes yourself, that boundaries aren\'t betrayals, that you can be sensitive without being a victim. When you anchor your vast spirit in your body, you become the bridge between heaven and earth.'
